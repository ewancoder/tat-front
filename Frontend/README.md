# TypingRealm Frontend

This is the frontend for TypingRealm project.

This is a analytics and training tool to gather statistics and improve your typing. In future, more gaming elements will be added to it until it's a full-fledged game. But the first iteration of this project is simple: gather statistics on typing for future learning and improvement.
